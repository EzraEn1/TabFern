TabFern organizes your browsing life.  It shows all your open windows and tabs
in one place, for immediate access.  With one click, you can close a window,
and then bring it back any time with one more click.  With two clicks, you can
backup all those URLs to a text file, or restore a backup.  No need to login to
copy browsing sessions between computers!  With TabFern, switching between
projects is a breeze, and you can leave a task behind without worrying about
losing the pages.

TabFern is under active development, so please do not hesitate to report bugs
or provide feedback via GitHub.  Because of its alpha status, TabFern is
offered AS-IS, and with NO WARRANTY - see the license on the Web site for full
details.  However, the primary author uses TabFern 365 days a year, so bug
reports should receive a quick response :) .  If you would like to contribute
to TabFern's development, feel free --- we welcome pull requests and would be
happy to help you get started.

Permissions: The "Read your browsing history" permission permits TabFern to 
access the URLs and titles of pages you visit, so that it can help you
manage your tabs.  TabFern stores that data only on your computer, and does not
send it anywhere.

Credit where credit is due!  TabFern is inspired by the excellent Tabs Outliner
by Vladyslav Volovyk.  However, TabFern is a completely separate extension,
and is not affiliated with Tabs Outliner or with Vladyslav in any way.
